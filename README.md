ðŸ’» Laptop Price Prediction

This project predicts laptop prices based on their specifications such as brand, CPU, RAM, storage, screen resolution, GPU, operating system, and weight.
It uses Python, Scikit-learn, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and feature engineering techniques to build a deployable prediction pipeline.

ðŸ“Œ Features

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, scales numeric features.

Feature Engineering: Extracts CPU brand/type, GPU type (integrated/dedicated), screen resolution details, and storage type.

Model Training: Uses Gradient Boosting Regressor with hyperparameter tuning via RandomizedSearchCV.

Model Evaluation: Calculates RÂ² Score, MAE, and RMSE for budget and premium laptop segments.

Deployment Ready: Model, encoders, and scaler are saved with joblib for easy integration into APIs or web apps.

ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset contains details of laptops including brand, type, inches, screen resolution, CPU, RAM, memory, GPU, operating system, and weight.

The target variable is Price (log-transformed during training).

You can replace the dataset with your own CSV file following the same structure.
