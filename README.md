# ðŸ’» Laptop Price Prediction

This project predicts laptop prices based on specifications such as brand, CPU, RAM, storage, screen resolution, GPU, and weight.  
It uses **Python, Scikit-learn, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and feature engineering techniques** to build a deployable prediction pipeline.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Data preprocessing with feature extraction
- Model training and hyperparameter tuning
- Model saved for deployment (`joblib`)
- API-ready pipeline
